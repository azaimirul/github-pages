My Name is Ahmad Zaimirul Bin Zainudin
Currently I'm studying at University Putra Malaysia
I'm a Sofware Engineering student
My interests are listening to music, cooking, running and travelling
I'm an optimist person in terms of giving up people to talk more.
I'm trying to adapt my new-norm learning
I really hate online class because it restricts me a lot including discussion with friends, asking for a help, facing with unstable internet connection and lastly it costs me some additional accessories just to have a class in front of the laptop. I hate it!
I really do not know how to stand with this kind of situation anymore because I'm losing my mind when I don't get achieve what I desired such as having a real-university life just like the older generations.
I have some kind of feeling insecure with the older generations such as early 90's and past. They're already faced the real-university life completely with the very happy-go-lucky ages when there's no smartphones or any other gadgets that separates the society's interactions compared to me that I've been in a beautiful lies just at the tips :''
I really don't know what to do right now. The world is too corrupt and vile to me. I'm really need someone who can be on my side when I have a trouble besides know how to provide me with the good advice tally with my generations.
Last but not least, thank you for anyone who read all these comments from the beginning till the end. I hope that we can have a better life in the future. Thank You.
